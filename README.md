Configuration
To integrate with the Stellar network, you must set up the Stellar SDK with your project. Follow the instructions below to configure the Stellar SDK.

The Stellar SDK allows you to interact with the Stellar network. It provides APIs to build and sign transactions, connect to Horizon, and more. Below is a guide on how to integrate the Stellar SDK into your project.

Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine
Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js
An existing Node.js project or a new one
Step 1: Install Stellar SDK
To use Stellar SDK, you need to install it via npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

Bash
npm install --save stellar-sdk
Use code with caution.
Step 2: Import Stellar SDK
In the JavaScript file where you want to use the Stellar SDK, import it at the top of the file:

JavaScript
const StellarSdk = require('stellar-sdk');
Use code with caution.
Step 3: Set Up Server Connection
To interact with the Stellar network, you need to connect to a Horizon server. You can connect to the public Horizon server or set up your own.

JavaScript
const server = new StellarSdk.Server('https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org');
Use code with caution.
Step 4: Create a Key Pair
To create a new Stellar account, you need a key pair consisting of a public key and a secret key.

JavaScript
const pair = StellarSdk.Keypair.random();
console.log("Public Key:", pair.publicKey());
console.log("Secret Key:", pair.secret());
Use code with caution.
Step 5: Create an Account
To create an account on the Stellar testnet, you can use the Friendbot service to fund your account with test Lumens (XLM).

JavaScript
(async function() {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=${encodeURIComponent(pair.publicKey())}`
  );
  const responseJSON = await response.json();
  console.log("Account created:", responseJSON);
})();
Use code with caution.
Step 6: Building and Submitting a Transaction
To send a transaction, such as sending Lumens to another account, you need to build and sign the transaction before submitting it to the network.

JavaScript
(async function() {
  const account = await server.loadAccount(pair.publicKey());
  const transaction = new StellarSdk.TransactionBuilder(account, {
    fee: StellarSdk.BASE_FEE,
    networkPassphrase: StellarSdk.Networks.TESTNET
  })
    .addOperation(StellarSdk.Operation.payment({
      destination: 'RECIPIENT_PUBLIC_KEY',
      asset: StellarSdk.Asset.native(),
      amount: '10'
    }))
    .setTimeout(30)
    .build();

  transaction.sign(pair);

  try {
    const transactionResult = await server.submitTransaction(transaction);
    console.log("Transaction successful:", transactionResult);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Transaction failed:", error);
  }
})();
Use code with caution.
Conclusion
You have now integrated the Stellar SDK into your Node.
